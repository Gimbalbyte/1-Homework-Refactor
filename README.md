# 1_Homework_Refactor

Description
    
    This repository contains the refactored html for the marketing management page for Horiseon. Refactoring is the process of altering code so as to improve it without changing its function to meet a certain set of standards and/or to implement a new technology. 
    
    The refactoring that took place within this html was the process of adding accessability features. These features include things like adding alt attribute to the existing image anchors for the purpose of providing alternate information of the image to those who cannot view it. All of the images now contain alt attributes. 

    The other refactoring that occured was adding semantic based tags. The original html did not contained any semantic based tags, the only tags it included was the div. Through refactoring semantic tags were added. Underneath the body the div tags were changed to header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer in that order. 

    During the course of refactoring changes to the spacing was also done simply for the purpose of making the html more readable (for me at least). The html also included errant id's for two item which did not connect to the CSS and therefore eliminated.
